Plum: Prompted Language Model Applications
==========================================

Plum is a framework for LLM-based web applications for education (i.e., with a
focus on instructors and their classes of students as users).
The repository contains two different applications that use Plum as a
foundation:

1. CodeHelp: A tool for assisting students in computer science classes without
   giving them solution code.
2. Starburst: A topic-exploration tool for writing assignments.


Install
-------

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

2. Install dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install the plum package and apps in 'editable' mode

  pip install -e .


Set Up an Application
---------------------

1. In the root of the repository, create .env and populate it:

  FLASK_INSTANCE_PATH=instance
  OPENAI_API_KEY=[your OpenAI API key]
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[...]
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[...]
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=[...]
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=[...]
  MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=[...]
  MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=[...]

Then, to set up the CodeHelp app, for example:

2. Initialize database

  flask --app codehelp initdb

3. Create at least one admin user

  flask --app codehelp newuser --admin [username]

This will create and display a randomly-generated password.
To change the password:

  flask --app codehelp setpassword [username]


Running an Application
----------------------

For example, to run the CodeHelp app:

  flask --app codehelp run
  
  # or, during development:
  flask --app codehelp --debug run


Running Tests
-------------

  pytest

For code coverage report (assuming 'coverage' package is installed):

  coverage run -m pytest && coverage html && xdg-open htmlcov/index.html
