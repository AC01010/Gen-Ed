      <p>It can explain issues and answer questions about your code.  It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a>, a large language model, so it can understand code and natural language queries and respond in natural language as well.</p>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask how to start writing a program.</li>
        <li>Get an explanation of a confusing error message.</li>
        <li>Ask why your code isn't working correctly in a particular spot.</li>
        <li>Learn more about specific syntax, functions, or techniques in your programming language of choice.</li>
        <li>... and a lot more.</li>
