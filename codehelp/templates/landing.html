      <h1>CodeHelp is a tool that can help you while you code.</h1>
      <p>It can explain issues and answer questions about your code.  It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">large language models (LLMs)</a> to understand code and natural language queries and respond in natural language as well.</p>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask how to start writing a program.</li>
        <li>Get an explanation of a confusing error message.</li>
        <li>Ask why your code isn't working correctly in a particular spot.</li>
        <li>Learn more about specific syntax, functions, or techniques in your programming language of choice.</li>
        <li>... and a lot more.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box content is-large">
      <h2>For instructors:</h2>
      <p>CodeHelp helps your students any time they have a question, and it provides help <i>without writing code</i> for them.  It is made specifically to guide and explain, not just provide solution code.</p>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporate LLMs into your teaching in a managed way, offering your students the eductional benefits LLMs can provide without compromising academic integrity.</li>
        <li>Tailor responses to your class by providing keywords that responses should not use (e.g. <code>sum()</code> if you want students practicing for loops instead of using a built-in function).</li>
        <li>Gain insights into what your students are working on and the sorts of questions they are asking.</li>
        <li>Connect it to your LMS, so everyone in your class can log in via a simple link without creating and managing a separate account.</li>
      </ul>
