      <p>It can explain issues and answer questions about your code.  It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a>, a large language model, so it can understand code and natural language queries and respond in natural language as well.</p>
      <p>You can ask it for help with a specific part of your code or an error message you're receiving, or you can just ask it a general question about programming in your chosen language.</p>
